Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: Add Qualcom QCA807x driver

This adds driver for the Qualcomm QCA8072 and QCA8075 PHY-s.

They are 2 or 5 port IEEE 802.3 clause 22 compliant 10BASE-Te, 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T PHY-s.

They feature 2 SerDes, one for PSGMII or QSGMII connection with MAC, while second one is SGMII for connection to MAC or fiber.

Both models have a combo port that supports 1000BASE-X and 100BASE-FX fiber.

Each PHY inside of QCA807x series has 4 digitally controlled output only pins that natively drive LED-s.
But some vendors used these to driver generic LED-s controlled by userspace,
so lets enable registering each PHY as GPIO controller and add driver for it.

These are commonly used in Qualcomm IPQ40xx, IPQ60xx and IPQ807x boards.
