Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Drop unneeded model for Radxa CM3i
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With module and carrier board topology, carrier board dts will include
module dtsi files for creating complete platform.

The carrier board dts will have final model name and compatible string
so any model name added in module dtsi will eventually replaced.

This happened for any devicetree property if the same property is updated
or added twice.

So, drop this unneededÂ model name from module dtsi.
