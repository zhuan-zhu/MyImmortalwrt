Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq6018: include the GPLL0 as clock
 provider for mailbox

While the kernel is booting up, APSS PLL will be running at 800MHz with
GPLL0 as source. Once the cpufreq driver is available, APSS PLL will be
configured to the rate based on the opp table and the source also will
be changed to APSS_PLL_EARLY. So allow the mailbox to consume the GPLL0,
with this inclusion, CPU Freq correctly reports that CPU is running at
800MHz rather than 24MHz.
